# IRIS_Dataset_Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Clustering_by Emmanuel Humbert

This project explores the Iris dataset using dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. It analyzes the relationships between principal components and evaluates 
clustering performance using a variety of metrics and visualizations. The goal is to extract meaningful patterns, reduce data complexity, and identify clusters effectively.

KEY OBJECTIVES

Dimensionality Reduction: 

Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality.
Analyze variance, eigenvalues, cosÂ², and contributions of variables to principal components.
Visualize results building multiple scatter plots (3D and 2D), biplots, correlation circles

Clustering Analysis:

Apply Clustering methods to group the data into clusters.
Assess clustering performance with scores and visualizations.
